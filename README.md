=============================
Intially made as a project for my Java course
Java GUI that makes a greeting card
Main is located in Assig5.java
Assig5.java uses two JPanels, multiple JButtons, JLabels, etc. It also has a class that implements MouseAdapter and
a class that implements MouseMotionAdapter.
MyShape.java is an interface. The drawPanel in Assig5 extends MyShape.
The files such as Tree.java and Cabin.java are shapes and polygons that are used in the drawPanel. 
MyText extends MyShape, but creates a new method called setText.
